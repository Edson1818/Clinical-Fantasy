I would like to develop a feature that assigns each player in the team a rating out of 5 stars, reflecting their likelihood of delivering returns (e.g., goals, assists, or clean sheets). 

This system would leverage the tier structure, factoring in both the strength of the playerâ€™s team and the opposition they face.

Additionally, I aim to analyse how specific players (e.g., Player X) have historically performed against teams of varying tiers during the season, particularly focusing on recent gameweeks. 

This data would be integrated into the rating system, offering a more nuanced and data-driven approach to player assessment.
