Overview

This project is designed to scrape, store, and analyze Expected Goals (xG) statistics for football teams, with a focus on Fantasy Football applications. The pipeline automates the extraction of key performance metrics from my data source, processes the data, and stores it in an AWS RDS PostgreSQL database for further analysis.

Key Features

1. Automated Data Scraping

Uses Selenium to navigate and extract data from Understat.

Implements BeautifulSoup for structured HTML parsing.

Runs in a headless Chrome browser to efficiently scrape data.

Extracts xG, xGA, matches played, and per-game statistics for home and away teams.

2. Local Storage in SQLite

Data is first stored locally in an SQLite database (gw24.db).

Tables include home_stats and away_stats, which maintain structured team performance data.

Implements a timestamping mechanism to track when data is last updated.

3. Cloud Migration to AWS RDS

Transfers data from SQLite to AWS RDS PostgreSQL.

Uses environment variables to securely load database credentials.

Ensures efficient and safe data transfer using transaction management.

4. Task Scheduling

Uses APScheduler to run the scraping process at regular intervals.

Automates the data pipeline for up-to-date statistics.

5. Error Handling & Logging

Implements structured logging to track scraping and database operations.

Handles common scraping errors (timeouts, missing elements, unexpected structure changes).

Includes rollback mechanisms to prevent database corruption.
