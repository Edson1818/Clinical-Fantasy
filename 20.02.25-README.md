Optimizing Data Management for Fantasy Football Analysis

Transitioning from .CSV to SQL Database

One of the key improvements in this project has been moving from storing data in .csv files to using a [SQL database](SQL_database.png). This change makes it easier to track trends over multiple gameweeks, as all the information is stored in one place rather than scattered across multiple files. Instead of manually searching through different .csv files, SQL allows for quick queries to retrieve and analyze data efficiently.

Future Move: PostgreSQL to AWS RDS

Currently, the project uses PostgreSQL for data storage, but the goal is to transition to AWS RDS in the future. One of the main advantages of AWS RDS is that it allows automated data scraping to run in the background without requiring the machine to be turned on. This will streamline the data collection process and improve overall efficiency.

Combining Notebook Files with Python Scripts

To improve readability and debugging, this project integrates notebook files with Python scripts. Jupyter notebooks are great for step-by-step analysis, but Python scripts are cleaner for running processes efficiently. By combining both, the project maintains flexibility for exploratory analysis while keeping the main scripts structured and easy to debug.

These changes help create a more efficient and scalable system for managing fantasy football data, ensuring smoother analysis and automation in the long run.
