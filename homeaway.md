# Home and Away Data
The first tool I am developing for my project focuses on analysing home and away performance data. I believe that teams often perform differently depending on the location of their matches. By concentrating on key metrics such as xG (expected goals) and xGA (expected goals against), this tool aims to provide valuable insights into the strength of a team’s attack and defence. This information can be particularly useful for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) players when making informed decisions about selecting, buying, or selling players.
